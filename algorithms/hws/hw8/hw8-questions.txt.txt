Pick 5 out of 6

1) 34.4-7
Let 2-CNF-SAT be the set of satisfiable boolean formulas in CNF with exactly 2 literals per clause. Show that 2-CNF-SAT 2 P. Make your algorithm as efficient as possible. (Hint: Observe that x _ y is equivalent to :x ! y. Reduce 2-CNF-SAT to an efficiently solvable problem on a directed graph.)

2) 34.5-1
The subgraph-isomorphism problem takes two undirected graphs G1 and G2 ,and
it asks whether G1 is isomorphic to a subgraph of G2. Show that the subgraph-
isomorphism problem is NP-complete.

3) 34.5-2 
Given an integer m x n matrix A and an integer m-vector b,the 0-1 integer-programming problem asks whether there exists an integer n-vector x with elements in the set {0,1} such that Ax <= b . Prove that 0-1 integer programming is NP-complete. ( Hint: Reduce from 3-CNF-SAT.)

4) 34-1 c &d
c. Give an efficient algorithm to solve the independent-set problem when each ver- tex in G has degree 2 . Analyze the running time, and prove that your algorithm works correctly.

d. Give an efficient algorithm to solve the independent-set problem whenGis bipartite. Analyze the running time, and prove that your algorithm works correctly. (Hint:Use the results of Section 26.3.)

5) 34-3a
a. Give an efficient algorithm to determine a2-coloring of a graph, if one exists.
