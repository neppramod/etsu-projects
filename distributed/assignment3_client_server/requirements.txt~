HW 2 Distributed

D • Combile the two programs from Homework 1 into one program
D • When the main program starts up, it should start the client code in its own thread
D• Server starts before client code
D • Lable screen message Server: or Client:
D • Use portnums file for server for lower and upper bound for port numbers

Client
D . Commandline parameters are no longer used.
. Use one of the nodes in list of connections (implemented in Homework 1).
. This list should be now stored in a text file called neighbors on exit.
. If the file does not exist or it's empty, prompt the user for the name of a server and port number.
. When a client sends first message (type 0) to another node send its name in domainName and portnumber; that other node should record it in its list.
. Be sure to only record these requests once in the list - a node might get several connections over time from same client, so check list for no duplicates

Client
D . Client should present a simple menu of choices on standard input, asking for either a query or to exit.
D . Simply send a sample query to the other node and get a sample response.
D . When the client quits, the server does not - it needs to be killed manually.
