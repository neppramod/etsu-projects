Are we supposed to add the attributes for nutritional, cost, and source information?  

No, you're not supposed to add the attributes; that was just mentioned by way of additional information.  Maybe I'll ask people to do this in a subsequent design or implementation; we'll see.

Also, it says "each layer has a crust" - is that supposed to be some kind of pizza that has more than one pizza.  I don't understand how we would've known any of this from the directions and information given.

As for the multi-layer pizza requirement, the following is straight from the spec:

Level 4 (8 points):  your design handles level 3 and also supports a Giordano's classic:  i.e., the stacking of up to 4 layers of a patron's choice in a single pizza.

One-layer pizza? Does it just have crust?

Each layer has a crust, a base, and at least one topping.

What is the arugula class constructor?  I don't understand.

Arugula is a type of salad green that's used as a pizza topping.   The idea is to treat each topping as a separate class; doing so would allow you to attribute the topping objects with (e.g.) nutritional, cost, and source information, by way of putting the completed pizza structure to other uses.
