Assumptions
===========

1. Used specific port of 9090 define in properties of PersonalGPATracker project.
2. URL_PORT defines the URL in GPATrackerCoursePage class in TestingFramework project.
3. Created single GPATrackerCoursePage.cs TestingFramework file and single Chrome.cs WebDriverFramework files.
4. For totalGPA calculation and totalQualityPoints in UpdateTotalGPA test used a range of floating point values close to expected value.
5. Created a function with Given attribute that adds a seed course before start of operations that requires previous value to exist. This function does what Add feature would do in multiple functions.
6. For checking whether a course exists in the list, the table row count of 1 (that only contains the headers) is considered as empty and count of rows that is greater than 1 is considered as having course entries. For asserting the value, I read whole table row along with edit, details link. Earlier I was just checking for the course code. This makes it easy to assert edit and added values.
