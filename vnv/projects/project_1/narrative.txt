Sword
=====
# One melee warrior from each army is allowed a sword.
# A sword has a melee power in the range of 3 to 6.
# A warrior's melee power is increased by the swords melee power when that warriro has a sword.

# Any magic warrior that moves to that cell will automatically pick up that staff if the warriro does not currently have a staff


# Damage
========
Damage to an opponent is calculated with:
1. Melee damage = melee power - (opponent's defense percentage * melee power)
2. Magic damage = magic power - (opponent's defense percentage * magic power)

# Power increase

# After a warrior vanquishes an opponent, the various powers increase by a factor
# Defense percentage increases by 1%.
# In melee warriors, melee power increases by 1 and magic power increases by .25.
# In magic warriors, magic power increases by 1 and melee power increases by .25

Attack
------
# After a warrior attacks an opponent, the attack powers of the attacker increase by a factor.
# In melee warriros, melee power increases by .5 and magic power increases by .125
# In magic warriors, magic power increases by .5 and melee power increases by .125

# After a warrior gets attacked, defense percentage of the attacked warrior increases by .25% (the warrior learns to defend)
# After a warrior moves, defense power increases by .125% (the warrior learns to evade).

Player
======
# Two
# Control army of 6 warriros

Play
----
# Each player decides how many of each warrior type he/she will need.
# At the start of the game each player takes turn positioning her/his warriors at opposite ends of the field.
# The warriors can be placed in any configuraion, at any position, in the top 2 rows or at the bottom two rows.
# After the warriors are positioned, the players take turns moving and attacking with their warriors.
# Each player has two moves per turn
    - move-move, move-attack, attack-move, or attack-attack.
    - At each move, a player may "look at statistics," "move", "attack", or "surrender"

Moving
------
# Warriors may move to an unoccupied cell in any direction. The battlefield is enclosed so they cannot move off it.

Attacking
----------
# Melee attacks only affect a warrior in an adjacent cell
# Magic attacks affect warriors in an adjacent cell or two cells away.
# If the target is two cells away and there is a warriro in the way, that warrior is not affected.
# A player may attack any cell inclusive of the cell of the attacking warrior.
# Warriors may vanquish their own warriors inclusive of themselves

Winning
-------
# The winner of the game is the player with at least one warrior left on the field.
# If all warriors cannot be vanquished then the player with the most warriors is the winner, a tie otherwise.
# A player also wins if the other player "surrenders".
